# SEIS744IoT
IoT Final Project 

For my final IoT project, I attempted to create a smart garage door opener. I used a particle relay shield, along with a particle photon for this project. I unfortunately did not have any success with the project but I believe if I implement the right wires into the relay, I should be able to get the opener to work.
